# Apex Legends Status Rotation

A discord bot to display the current server status for Apex Legends, updating automatically on a set interval. Requires Node 14 and D.JS 13.

# Setup

Simply clone the repo into a folder, and then run `npm ci` to install all the dependencies. Make a copy of config.json.example and name it config.json, then fill in the needed values.

`npm run dev` runs the dev environment for testing, and `node Rotation.js` will run the bot for production. I suggest something like PM2 if you plan on running the bot on a server.
